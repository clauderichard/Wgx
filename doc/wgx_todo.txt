Wgx future Concepts
* Genlang should have some more advanced operators.
	Like combining property reference with function (e.g. duration += some value)
* Some events should change some wave parameters.
* Some events should change parameters of other events.
* Genlang should have "gradients" enabled for pitch bend.
	Syntax may be similar to that of Ukz.
	Syntax may look like the bezier syntax in Wavelang.
	Pitch bend should not be limited to 2 semitones!
* There should be one more kind of events: Assignment.
	An Assignment has a name and a real value. It assigns the "variable"
	of that name to the specified value.
	Syntax for Assignments to be determined.
* Wavelang should enable referencing of
	named variables (define the syntax for this in Wavelang),
	and Genlang can assign to the same variables in memory.
* A wgx file should be able to import text from another file.
* Triple-squiggles should go away.
* Voices and effects should be more clearly marked.
	(maybe with the word "voice" etc)
* DFT for fancy drum sounds?
	Define a wave as being the IDFT of some frequency spectrum.
    Should that spectrum be a function of time?
    If it can perform well, sure. I will find out.

_ Wgx future tasks
	/ Use one file for Wavelang/Egglang script
	/ use bof/eof instead of triple-squiggles
	/ voice keyword
	_ effect keyword
	_ Refactor ops to enable _*, pitch/, etc.
	_ Pull Trex, use it from gradients
	_ Var assignment events (name := egg ?)
	_ Var-referencing events ($name)
	_ Real-Var assignment events (name := double)
	_ Wavelang var-references (modified by eggs)
	_ Named parks with arguments
	_ "import" statements
	_ refactor my parks/worlds (Freeverb, waveSmooth etc)
	_ iDFT with variable frequency spectrum? in genlang
