For each note on the left, do the whole right melody with it.
    That means, start a thread of the right, but
    translate every note up by left pitch,
    and expand it by LHS's duration.
The LHS should sort of march along at its own pace (not expanded in time),
    but every time a note happens in LHS, it instead starts a thread of a
    modified copy of RHS.
    Modification being: transpose by LHS pitch, expand by LHS duration.
    LHS notes themselves are not played, of course. They're overwritten
    by the modified RHS thread.
