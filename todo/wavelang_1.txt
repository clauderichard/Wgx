/ Wavelang 1.0 completion
	/ exp, log unary funcs (already there)
	/ Rex: remove TrexSpecies-specific functions.
	/ Make WaveLang.cpp use crealp instead of Rex (for operators only)
	/ pi and tau
	/ Parse tree printer (with strings, not numbers)
	/ null Rex (for Bezier)
	/ JurassicWorld derived from another (default parks are in defaultWorld, which gets copied)
	/ TimeTrex (use size_t counter for accuracy etc. IntroducesChange()=true)
	/ Default Rexes in each JurassicWorld (freq, phase, time, Time)
	/ $ for note-variables ($pitch, $duration)
	/ Set $duration variable from note's duration
	/ Add time and Time variables
	/ Bezier waves
	/ Parser avoid doing a rule if incompatible with previous token in stack.
	/ Bezier waves nicer syntax.
	/ Bezier functions with x-values other than "phase". e.g.  amp = time bezier 0,0 -- 0.1,1 -- 0.2,0.5 -- 0.98,0.5 -- 1,0;
	/ JurassicUniverse (several named worlds!) (without squiggle3 somehow?)
	
/ Wavelang 1.0 cleanup
	/ Traverser instructions as classes.
	/ Traverser list1 traverseStar append to vector.
	/ Wavelang output should be map<string,shared_ptr<IVoice>>.
	/ Replace all pointers to delete, with shared_ptr<>. Except where efficiency is paramount (Workforce etc) or a couple more places.
	/ Delete commented-out crap.
	
Wavelang 1.0 Concept
	A language, parsed from a text file,
	to describe a "voice".
	A voice takes as input one note, which has
	a duration and a pitch.
	The output is a stream of samples for the waveform.
	Output may be different for left and right ear.
	Frequency and phase available by default,
	without defining the formula at every Wave.
	Can use arithmetic to make functions of the output.
	Can compose functions in complex ways.
	Can describe a function with control points
	(y = f(x) using Bezier stuff).
	Voice results are meant to be used to play a melody
	(stream of notes) in real-time or output a WAV file.
