
Genlang 1.0 Concept
* Genlang 1.0 can be syntactically similar to UKZ.
* Unlike Ukz, the output of a Genlang script is an object
	from which you can pull a stream of Note objects.
	It is a (potentially infinite) stream of notes, not an array.
* The concepts of sequential and parallel hierarchical "melodies" remains.
	But in Genlang, resolving the ordering of notes happens at "runtime"
	while iterating through the resulting stream,
	not while interpreting (traversing) the script.
* There should be an elegant way to define a sequence as recurring.
	"loop G" should take any generator as G, and loop through it infintely.
	When G conks out, it gets reset and its first event is returned again.
* There should be at least one kind of events: Note.
	A Note has similar info as in Ukz (pitch, duration, loudness ...).
	Syntax for a Note can be similar to Ukz.
* There will be different kinds of events later, so polymorphism
	should be used wisely for this one kind of Event.
* Ability of Events to have their delta times changed
	by another event: for the future.
	Conceptually, when an event is yielded by a generator,
	its post-delta time is snapshottedand that snapshot
	is used to keep track of when to yield the next event.
	If something modifies the just-yielded event's post-delta,
	the next event's start time is unaffected
	(because snapshot is unaffected).
	No possibility of parole!
* For assignments to be used, Wavelang must enable referencing of
	named variables (define the syntax for this in Wavelang),
	and Genlang must assign to the same variables in memory.
* For demonstration, use a named variable in a wave shape,
	and assign to that variable several times in a song.
