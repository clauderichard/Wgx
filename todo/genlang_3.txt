Genlang 3.0 Concept
* Genlang should have some more advanced operators.
	Like melody inject, and 
	combining property reference with function (e.g. duration += some value)
* Genlang should have "gradients" enabled for pitch bend.
	Syntax may be similar to that of Ukz.
	Syntax may look like the bezier syntax in Wavelang.
	Pitch bend should not be limited to 2 semitones!
* There should be one more kind of events: Assignment.
	An Assignment has a name and a real value. It assigns the "variable"
	of that name to the specified value.
	Syntax for Assignments to be determined.
* For assignments to be used, Wavelang must enable referencing of
	named variables (define the syntax for this in Wavelang),
	and Genlang must assign to the same variables in memory.
* For demonstration, use a named variable in a wave shape,
	and assign to that variable several times in a song.

_ Genlang 3.0 Completion
	_ Refactor ops to enable _*, pitch/, etc.
	_ Add operator << (MelInject generator)
	_ End Pipe (which part of Par has length)
	_ Different pipe, to kill parent when self conks out (for Par) (throw true instead of false?)
		Or throw ints instead of bools? Representing blast radius...
	_ Pull Trex, use it from gradients
	_ ...
