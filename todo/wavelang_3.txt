Wavelang 3.0 Concept
* My Hierachy of Sounds.
  * A wave file should be able to import another file.
  * Triple-squiggles should go away.
  * I should have a bunch of files to start with.
  * Voices and effects should be more clearly marked.
	(maybe with the word "voice" etc)
  * JurassicParks should be importable somehow too,
    not only Worlds.
* Drum sounds
  * White noise should be available. TrexNoise?
  * DFT should be usable. Define a wave as being the
    IDFT of some frequency spectrum.
    Should that spectrum be a function of time?
    If it can perform well, sure. I will find out.
	
_ Wavelang 3.0
	/ TrexNoise (44100 rands from 0 to 1)
	/ tokenize line-by-line, don't build string first
	_ voice & effect keywords
	/ move default parks (freq etc) to scripts
	_ Named parks with arguments
	_ use bof/eof instead of triple-squiggles
	_ "import" statements
	_ import Worlds
	_ import Parks
	_ refactor my parks/worlds (Freeverb, waveSmooth etc)
	_ iDFT with variable frequency spectrum? in genlang
