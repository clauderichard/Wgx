Genlang 2.0 Concept
* Genlang should enable some random melodies!
* Language should free up one kind of brackets
  to use for arguments lists
* More control over flow of par/seq melodies
* Some events should change some wave parameters.
* Some events should change parameters of other events.

_ Genlang 2.0 Completion
	/ Change [],() to {},<>
	/ Refactor eggs (Seq,Par,Forever,Repeat) into Forker
	/ End Pipe (which part of Par has length)
	/ Death pipe, to kill parent when self conks out (for Par)
	/ Rand egg
	/ Melody-inject operator! work with random/cycle on both sides
	_ Var assignment events (name := egg ?)
	_ Var-referencing events ($name)
	_ Real-Var assignment events (name := double)
	_ Wavelang var-references (modified by eggs)
	_ Example random song!
	_ Cleanup
